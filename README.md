# BIOS 6643 Final Project 

Individuals who classified as overweight or obese were enrolled into the study to understand factors that contribute to weight loss, and to understand how well weight loss is maintained over time. Participants were separated into two groups. One group had a nutritionist, and the other group did not. Both groups received free access to the Wellness center at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Participants were asked to step on a Bluetooth scale once a day over the course of the study. Within the study, there are 3 cohorts. These cohorts indicate participants who started the study around the same time. This study is ongoing, so we do not have access to intervention groupings. Additionally, complete data has not been collected for all participants.

The research questions of interest are : 
      
-	What is the trajectory of weight over the duration of time in the study?   

-	Is there a significant decrease in weight over the course of the study, regardless of intervention group?
