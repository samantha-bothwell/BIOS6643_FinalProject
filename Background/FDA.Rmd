## What is Functional Data Analysis (FDA)

Functional Data Analysis deals with repeated measures over time, whether the time intervals are evenly spaced or sporadic. FDA models data through curves or functions [2]. 

## Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA)

Functional data is often high dimensional. FPCA offers a solution to reduce the data dimensions [1].
